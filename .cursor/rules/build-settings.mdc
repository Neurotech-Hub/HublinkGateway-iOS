# Build Settings and Plist Management

The user manages all build settings, Info.plist configuration, and project settings directly through Xcode. 

**Do not:**
- Create or modify Info.plist files manually
- Edit project.pbxproj files directly
- Modify build settings in code
- Add Bluetooth permissions or other plist keys programmatically

**Instead:**
- Focus on Swift code implementation
- Let the user handle all Xcode project configuration
- Assume proper permissions and settings are configured in Xcode
- Provide guidance on what settings need to be configured if needed

The user will handle:
- Bluetooth usage descriptions in Info.plist
- Build configurations and targets
- Deployment settings
- Code signing and provisioning
- Any other Xcode-specific configurations
